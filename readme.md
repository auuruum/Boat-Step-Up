# Boat Step Up Mod for Minecraft 1.21

Welcome to the **Boat Step Up** mod repository! This mod was initially developed for Minecraft 1.19.2, allowing boats to step up one block in height. However, with the update to Minecraft 1.21, the critical `maxStepUp` function, which powered this feature, has been removed, and now the mod requires adjustments to work with the new version.

I am seeking assistance from those experienced in Minecraft modding to help adapt this mod to the latest version.

## ðŸ“¢ Current Issue

In Minecraft 1.21, the `maxStepUp` function, crucial to the mod's functionality, has been deprecated or removed. This mod relies on this function to allow boats to smoothly "step up" over obstacles, such as one-block elevations, instead of stopping abruptly. Without it, boats no longer behave as intended when encountering small height changes.

## ðŸ’¡ How You Can Help

Iâ€™m looking for contributions in the following areas:

- **Replacing or emulating `maxStepUp` behavior**: Suggestions or code that can replicate this functionâ€™s behavior in Minecraft 1.21.
- **General improvements**: Any other enhancements or refactoring to optimize the modâ€™s code.
